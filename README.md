# "High Paw!"

My second website created to learn how to build a user form, accordion with some questions and a carousel with some pictures. I also learned how to use grid layout, as well as multipage website.

## Information

In the accordion section I used info from an existing  website, you can check it [here](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/pet-help-and-advice/looking-after-your-pet/kittens-cats/the-best-diet-for-your-cat).
